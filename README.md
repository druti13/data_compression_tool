# Data Compression Tool

This project implements a Huffman coding algorithm for compressing and decompressing files. The tool is written in Python and can be used to compress a text file and store the compressed data in the same file.


## How It Works

The Huffman coding algorithm is used to compress and decompress the contents of a file. The compressed data is written back to the same file, overwriting the original content. Upon decompression, the file content is restored to its original state.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Place the file you want to compress in the project directory (e.g., `file_name.txt`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to compress and then decompress the file:

   ```sh
   python main.py


##The file will be compressed and then decompressed, with the results visible in the same file.
